# Set Up the Environment:

## Install Docker Desktop:

1. Visit the Docker Desktop for Windows download page.
2. Download the Docker Desktop installer.
3. Double-click Docker Desktop Installer.exe to run the installer.
4. Follow the installation instructions.

## Verify Installation:

1. Open a command prompt (Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt).
2. Run the command: docker --version
It should show client and server both installation where client is our host os command Prompt and server is Docker Engine.

Run the hello-world Image docker run hello-world.

## Create and use a Docker container interactively

```
docker run -it ubuntu bash
```

In this command -i refers to an interactive, -t refers to the tag that needs to be pulled. ubuntu is the tag name that gets pulled, bash is the command that would be run interactively.

![image](https://github.com/ananthan05/Secure-Systems-Engineering/assets/140697378/fddd75dc-ee20-42ad-8812-24dbc6cc6bc9)

```
docker images
```

## Create a Dockerfile, which allows you to declaratively define your containers

Create a file named Dockerfile in the current directory with the following contents.

```
FROM ubuntu:bionic

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3.6 --no-install-recommends

CMD ["/usr/bin/python3.6",Â "-i"]
```

Build an image using the instructions written in the Dockerfile.

```
docker build -t mypython:latest .
```

![image](https://github.com/ananthan05/Secure-Systems-Engineering/assets/140697378/5fd912f7-ec43-408d-9e28-662b2cd290b5)

Verify the created Docker Image.

```
docker images
```

![image](https://github.com/ananthan05/Secure-Systems-Engineering/assets/140697378/81991179-5e64-4557-98cd-280f4b12dc7a)

Interactively run the Docker Image and execute Python commands.

```
docker run -it mypython
```
![image](https://github.com/ananthan05/Secure-Systems-Engineering/assets/140697378/427be1b6-4c1f-45fb-82b5-60814da14eed)

## Run detached containers and understand port forwarding

```
docker run -d -p=5050:80 httpd
```
The -d in the above command instructs the Docker Engine to run the container in detached mode. This will make the container to keep running until we explicitly stop it.

The httpd is the name of an image already built and available in the Docker Hub. The -p flag takes in a colon separated pair of HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT.

httpd image is downloaded successfully.

If we check in browser it works.

##  Use docker-compose to run a multi-container web application

docker compose is installed by typing the below commands in the Terminal. As windows is there as hostOS, So docker compose is available

```
docker-compose version
```

A Dockerfile is written in the project directory which would contain the instructions required for the deployment of the NodeJS project.

The NodeJS project is downloaded from the provided location by typing the below commands. 

git clone https://github.com/0xcf/decal-sp18-a10 by dowloading it in to our computer.

And create a file Docker and insert this content there.

```
FROM node:10-alpine
 RUN mkdir-p /app/node_modules && \
 chown-R node:node /app
 WORKDIR /app
 COPY package*.json .
 USER node
 RUN npm install && \
 npm install nodemon
 COPY--chown=node:node . .
 EXPOSE 8080
 CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

create a file Docker and insert this content there.

```
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build:
      context: decal-sp18-a10
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: web
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "80:8080"
    command: ./wait-for database:27017 -- /app/node_modules/.bin/nodemon server.js
  database:
    image: mongo:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"

```

After creating the docker-compose.yml, both containers are built, started and ran interactively using the below command.

```
docker-compose up
```
